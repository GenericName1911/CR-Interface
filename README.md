# CR-Interface

This tool is a closed-source modding utility for Clash Royale, designed to simulate an interactive arena. It converts user-selected tiles into game coordinates, which are saved to a file named `coordinates.csv` and can be injected into the apk with [REDACTED] methods.
This tool is distributed in the form of ~~an executable file~~ [a python-compiled no-console file.](https://github.com/GenericName1911/CR-Interface/releases) 
All dependencies can be downloaded using the included setup.py file in Releases.

As of Monday, 16 December 2024 (UTC), every subsequent release will have a virus scan report attached to it.

   - ~~Compiled using `pyinstaller` and `UPX`~~
   - Compiled using native python tools.
   - Thanks a lot to **Milo the great** for beta testing.
